# Password Checker

A simple Python program that validates passwords with a 3-attempt limit.

## Features
- 3 attempts to enter correct password
- Shows remaining attempts after each wrong try
- Special message for first-try success
- Locks out after 3 failed attempts

## How to Run
```bash
python password_checker.py
```

## What I Learned
- While loops with counters
- Conditional logic (if/elif/else)
- User input validation
- F-strings for formatted output
